# My Résumé

Ensure you have [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed in
order to compile the code with `make`.

## Compilation

```bash
make # Creates a pdf file from the source code
```

## Secret

If you know the "secret" please ensure that you have
[sobolevn/git-secret](https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret) installed. After
cloning, run:

```bash
make secret # reveals the secret
make # then compile, secret should show in the resultant pdf
```
